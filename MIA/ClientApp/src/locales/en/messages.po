msgstr "The Arab media has been facing many challenges over the past decades, and has been lacking the proper Arab reality representation. Despite the great investment in the field of media, it lacks  concerted efforts between investors and production companies. In this respect, the Media Industry Company decided to create a TV award in an attempt to elevate the level of competition, develop the art industry content, and produce Arabic artwork. It also aims to be the link between the investor and the producer to put the Arab TV reality on the right track by creating such TV award. We also believe that the competition will lead to produce rich and unique content, which will be reflected on the audience in the Arab world."
