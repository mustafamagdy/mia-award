Despite the great investment in the field of media, it lacks  concerted efforts between investors and production companies. In this respect, the Media Industry Company decided to create a TV award in an attempt to elevate the level of competition, develop the art industry content, and produce Arabic artwork. It also aims to be the link between the investor and the producer to put the Arab TV reality on the right track by creating such TV award. We also believe that the competition will lead to produce rich and unique content, which will be reflected on the audience in the Arab world.","submit":"Submit","suggested_languages":"Suggested Languages","terms_conditions":"Terms & Conditions","ticket_desc":"ticket_desc","to":"To","today":"Today","update":"Update","upload_avatar":"Upload Avatar","upload_image":"Upload Image","usd":"usd","videos_desc":"videos_desc","view_all":"View All","view_awards":"View Awards","we_use_cookies_and_similar_technology":"We use cookies and similar technologies to recognize your repeated visits and preferences; to measure the affectiveness of publicity campaigns and to analyze traffic.
